Hi guys, I'm AnthoLaMalice, a Belgian Forensic and SOC L2 analyst working at [Easi](https://easi.net/fr). On the side, I like to play CTFs, especially on Root-Me.

I'm mainly interested in computer forensics and threat hunting. In my opinion, the most interesting thing about it is that you first need to be able to exploit a system and use the techniques of the Threat Actors to then be able to detect and protect against them. I'm also on the path of learning binary exploitation during my free time.  

If you have any question or simply want to have a chat, you can always reach me on Discord or Twitter (AnthoLaMalice).
